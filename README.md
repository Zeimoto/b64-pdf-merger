This small tool is capable of selecting multiple .txt files and merging them into a single PDF file.

To achieve this, you'll need to add your .txt, base64 encoded PDF files in the `docs/` folder, inside the repo's main directory, like so:

```bash
├── b64-pdf-merger
│   ├── docs
│   └── venv
```

After that, simply run main.py to merge your files into one PDF file!
