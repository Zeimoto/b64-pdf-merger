This small tool is capable of selecting multiple .txt files and merging them into a single PDF file.

To achieve this, you'll need to add your .txt, base64 encoded PDF files in the ´docs´ folder, insde the repo main directory, like so:

├── b64-pdf-merger
│   ├── docs

After that simply run main.py and merge your files into one PDF file.
